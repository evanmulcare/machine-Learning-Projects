## Project Tasks

### 1. Bayesian Classification - Sentiment Analysis (Naïve Bayes)
- Preprocessed and cleaned movie review text data.  
- Extracted word frequency features for positive and negative sentiments.  
- Implemented Naïve Bayes classifier.  
- Applied k-fold cross-validation.  
- Evaluated model using confusion matrices.

### 2. Supervised Learning - Fashion Item Classification
- Preprocessed and normalized image pixel data.  
- Implemented multiple classifiers: Perceptron, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines.  
- Performed k-fold cross-validation for each model.  
- Analyzed performance across different training sample sizes and runtime efficiency.

### 3. Regression and Optimization - Energy Performance Regression
- Created a polynomial regression model.  
- Used cross-validation to select the optimal polynomial degree.  
- Visualized predicted vs actual heating and cooling loads.
