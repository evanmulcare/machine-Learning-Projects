Project Tasks
1. Bayesian Classification - Sentiment Analysis (Naïve Bayes)

Preprocessed and cleaned movie review text data.

Extracted word frequency features for positive and negative sentiments.

Implemented Naïve Bayes classifier from scratch.

Applied k-fold cross-validation to optimize model parameters.

Evaluated model using confusion matrices.

2. Supervised Learning -  Fashion Item Classification

Preprocessed and normalized image pixel data.

Implemented multiple classifiers: Perceptron, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines.

Performed k-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for each model.

Analyzed performance across different training sample sizes and runtime efficiency.

3. Regression and Optimisation - Energy Performance Regression

Developed a custom polynomial regression model using the Gauss-Newton optimization method.

Calculated the Jacobian matrix for linearization of nonlinear regression.

Used cross-validation to select the optimal polynomial degree.

Visualized predicted vs actual heating and cooling loads.
